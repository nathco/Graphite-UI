## Why Graphite?  
Mac OS has a system preference for **Graphite** appearence. Unfortunately, Sketch does not. In my opinion, Sketchâ€™s interface feels a bit chintzy and the multi-colored icons are distracting. These graphite replacement icons will, hopefully, help designers focus on the content ( not the UI ), while still being quickly recognizable and accessible.
